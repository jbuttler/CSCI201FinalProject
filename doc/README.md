# CSCI201FinalProject

<< Functionality >>
-All functionality indicated in the most recent version of the documentation
 should be fully operational.

<< Nuances >>
-MySQL is expected to have user=root and password=root.
-The sql/ folder includes the code that should be run in MySQL before
 WebContent/SignIn.jsp is run to begin the site.
-The site should ideally be viewed via Google Chrome.
-Newly-added offerings should be immediately pushed to the Offerings page
 (observable with multiple tabs). The Home page does not have this same functionality,
 though Trending and Activity Map will reflect new Offerings after a refresh.
-The GUI went through some last-minute changes, so the color scheme and
 nagivation bar are slightly different from what is shown in the documentation.
